       <p>The WEB has been with me in one or another way  since the days of dialup and phpbb forums in 2001, but my working career turned to polygraphy. After the VCS course, I returned to what I love and after that I studied PHP all the time on my own because I admire that feeling tha u have tool create anything and especially systems that solve real problems: CRM, invoicing automation, optimization of production works, warehouse control, estimates calculations. I have written this for my own printhouse, which we have been using since 2019 (link <a href="https://emsis.lt/procedural" target="_blank">here </a>). <br> 
        I solve all problems with google. Do I often not solve something? No, it just takes longer.</p>

       <p><b>CV</b>: lease take a look at github: <a href="https://github.com/emikalajunas/cv_2022" target="_blank">https://github.com/emikalajunas/cv_2022</a>. This CV is written in PHP OOP, it is a real application with classes (DB, Session, User), multilingualism (constants), password_verify etc. written without a framework, using the udemy course methods to show the existing level of knowledge in PHP.</p>       
        <p><b>Work/Practice</b>. I want to move completely into the WEB programming. I don't want to create WP themes or modules for it (although I can create an editable WP theme from scratch), I want to work with systems, calculations and logic. The internship will not generate income, so if it is an internship option I cannot devote all 160 hours of the week to it but 2-3 working days - full + some additional homework for weekends or evenings for a period of 3-6 months. After that I want to completely say goodbye to the press and "switch" to programming. It would be nice to stay at the place of practice or receive some projects on the basis of a contract with my company because the company works profitably and stable I do not plan to liquidate it, but I want changes.<br></p>                
        <p><b>My strengths</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>intermediate/strong beginner level with PHP.</li>
            <li>Y generation. Discipline to finish what I start - hardened by 15 years of managerial experience. Knowledge: It is not perfect, but it is basic. I solve all other problems with google.</li>
            <li>real motivation to practice - I really need it.</li>
            <li>continuous learning - udemy. Some people read books, others knit, I like udemy.</li>
            <li>good English skills, technical thinking, long/comprehensive experience with iron and software since 386/486, which makes me never give up and look for solutions.</li>
        </ul>        
        <p><b>My weaknesses</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>weak knowledge of JS: level - google and VCS course in 2019.</li>
            <li>lack of real experience solving real problems makes my speed slow, taking time with searches. It's also likely that I'm leaving mountains of security holes, I don't know good practices, the architecture or consistency in the code could be better. </li>
        <li>I don't know any framework yet: I'm taking a Laravel course now. ~50% of 43 hours is finished.</li>
        </ul>
